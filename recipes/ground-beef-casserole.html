            <li>2 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>

            <li>1 (8 ounce) package egg noodles</li> 
            <li>1 cup sour cream</li> 
            <li>3 ounces cream cheese, softened</li> 
            <li>1 large white onion, diced</li> 
            <li>1/2 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, or more to taste</li>

          <ol> 
            <li>
              Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
            </li> 
            <li>
              Mix tomato sauce, sugar, garlic salt, and salt into the ground beef; simmer until flavors blend, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat, cover the skillet, and cool to room temperature.
            </li> 
            <li>
              While the sauce is cooking, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain.
            </li> 
            <li>
              While the egg noodles are cooking, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.
            </li> 
            <li>
              Mix sour cream, cream cheese, and onion together in a bowl.
            </li> 
            <li>
              Layer 1/2 of the egg noodles into the prepared casserole dish. Top with 1/2 of the sour cream mixture, then 1/2 of the ground beef mixture. Repeat layers once more. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over top.
            </li> 
            <li>
              Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.
            </li>
